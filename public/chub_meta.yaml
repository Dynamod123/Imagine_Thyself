creator_notes: "
This stage has the primary goal of altering your messages you send out by enhancing them with context from the story, making the message richer and deeper than initially presented. It takes away a little bit of your fine-tuned control over the direction of the story, but in return you are going to be able to sit back and give brief descriptions of your actions and enjoy them blossom into fully realized prose. If you're feeling lazy, or desiring an extra kick of creativity in your stories, or just want your model to punch up your texts… this stage is for you!
This Stage is Based on JakeH's 'Boss Mode' Stage. Check out the original mod here: https://chub.ai/extensions/JakeH/boss-mode-cfb0b7d36b1e
